# Glider Control System Simulation

## Background

The CS for the Glider must be tuned. This is a long process that, if done entirely in Saanich Inlet with an assembled Glider, would take a long time and involve risk of losing the Glider.

## Purpose

The control system can be simulated using this program, allowing for preliminary tuning parameters to be found

## Running

1. Create a config file, an example is provided (`config.json`)

2. Run the program with `python3 GliderCsSim.py`

## TODO

1. ROS 2 integration so parts of the Glider's actual CS may be tested.
